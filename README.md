# AddVentures
AddVentures is a travel mapping app built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It features user authentication and profile creation, allowing users to add, edit, and delete visited places with images and comments, as well as create a wishlist of places to visit in the future.


### What the project does
AddVentures allows users to pin and share the places they've visited around the world. They can upload images, leave comments, and organize their travels in a visually appealing way.
